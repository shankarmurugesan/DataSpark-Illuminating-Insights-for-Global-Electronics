**Project Overview: Global Electronics EDA**
**Introduction**
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Global Electronics, a leading retailer in the consumer electronics industry. The analysis aims to uncover valuable insights from various datasets, including customer, product, sales, store, and currency exchange rate data. These insights will empower the company to enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, improve sales forecasting, and make informed business decisions, ultimately driving customer satisfaction and overall business growth.

**Problem Statement**
As part of the Global Electronics data analytics team, the task is to:

Analyze the companyâ€™s data across customers, products, sales, and stores.
Provide actionable insights to help Global Electronics enhance operations, boost customer satisfaction, and drive growth.
Understand how currency exchange rates impact international sales and pricing strategies.
This analysis will focus on key business use cases, such as identifying trends in sales, understanding customer purchase patterns, optimizing store performance, and evaluating the profitability of products.

**Business Use Cases**
The project addresses the following business questions:

Customer Analysis: What are the demographic distributions of the customers, and what are their purchase behaviors?
Sales Analysis: How is the company performing in terms of sales over time, by product, by store, and by currency?
Product Analysis: What are the most and least popular products, and how do they contribute to profitability?
Store Analysis: How well are different stores performing based on their location, size, and sales data?
Currency Impact: How do exchange rates affect sales performance across regions?
Data Sources
Global Electronics has provided datasets containing:

Customer data (e.g., demographics, purchase history)
Product data (e.g., product categories, pricing)
Sales data (e.g., transaction records)
Store data (e.g., store locations, size, operational data)
Currency exchange rates (for sales conducted in multiple currencies)
Approach and Methodology
The project is divided into several key steps:

1.** Data Cleaning and Preparation**
Handle missing values.
Convert data types (e.g., dates, numerical values) for consistency.
Merge relevant datasets (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer information).
2. **Data Storage (SQL Integration)**
Load the cleaned data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each dataset (e.g., customers, products, sales, stores, exchange rates).
Use SQL queries to extract insights from the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Perform statistical analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies.
Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.
Analyze sales performance across time, product categories, and stores.
Evaluate the profitability of products and stores.
Understand the impact of currency exchange rates on sales.
4. **Data Visualization**
Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports.
Connect SQL databases to Power BI for seamless data flow.
Visualize sales performance, product trends, and customer demographics.
5. **SQL Query Development**
Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights:
Total sales over time.
Customer segmentation by demographics.
Top-performing products by sales volume.
Store performance by sales and location.
Currency impact on international sales.
Customer purchase frequency analysis.
Profit margin analysis for products.
Average order value over time.
Sales by product category and subcategory.
Geographical analysis of high-performing regions.
Results and Insights
Upon completing the project, the findings will be consolidated into a comprehensive EDA report that includes:

**Customer Demographics:** Insights into customer gender, age, and location distribution.
Purchase Patterns: Patterns such as frequent purchases, preferred products, and high-value transactions.
Sales Performance: An overview of sales trends over time, product-wise performance, and the influence of store location on revenue.
